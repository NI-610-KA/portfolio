        <h2>What is HTML</h2>
        <h4>The HyperText Markup Language, 
            or HTML is the standard markup language
            for documents designed to be displayed in
            a web browser. It can be assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
            (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</h4>
            <!--html elements-->
            <h2>What is HTML</h2>
            <h4>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
                With HTML constructs, images and other objects
                such as interactive forms may be embedded into 
                the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
                structured documents by denoting structural 
                semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
                links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are 
                delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
                Tags such as img and input directly introduce content 
                into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide 
                information about document text and may include other tags 
                as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but 
                use them to interpret the content of the page.</h4>
                <!--Development-->
                <h2>Development</h2>
                <h4>
                    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor
                    at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system
                    for CERN researchers to use and share documents. 
                    In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
                    Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee 
                    specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software
                    in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data 
                    systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a 
                    joint request for funding, but the project was not 
                    formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] 
                    from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which
                    hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

                <!--Markup-->
                <h2>Markup</h2>
                <h4>
                    HTML markup consists of several key components, including 
                    those called tags (and their attributes), character-based 
                    data types, character references and entity references.
                    HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like h1 and /h1, 
                    although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired,
                    for example img. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag,
                    and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags 
                    and closing tags).
